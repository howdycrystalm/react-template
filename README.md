# SHL React Template

This is a React starter for CCC SHL. 

React and Redux, Webpack 2 boilerplate from [Work & Co](https://work.co). To learn more about what features it has built in, check out their extremely well-documented [repo](https://github.com/workco/marvin).


## Adding Features

1. clone the project to your local computer
```
$ git clone 
```

2. create a new branch for the feature you will be working on
```
$ git checkout -b <feature-branch> // be specific in your naming, e.g. "portal-feature" 
```

3. push your code to your feature branch
```
$ git push -u origin <feature-branch> //  from here, git commit and push as you will
```

4. from your github GUI create a pull request on your branch asking to merge <feature> into <master>
